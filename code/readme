# The code of the proposed curvature-driven cloud removal method 
matlab vision
"Curvature_based_Image_Reconstruction.m" is function to achieve image reconstruction for each cloud area
"Whole_Image_Cloud_Removal_by_Curvature.m" is function to achieve image reconstruction for the whole image
run the "main.m", you can change the path to your data
